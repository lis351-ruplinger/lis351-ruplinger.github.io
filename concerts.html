		<h3>Niall Horan</h3>
		<p>Over the summer last year I went to see Niall Horan in concert in St. Paul, Minnesota. I was a big fan of the band that he was a part of, One Direction, and I was so excited to see him in concert. He even sang a One Direction song which made me really excited.</p>

		<h3>Gregory Alan Isakov</h3>
		<p>Also last summer I had the chance to go to Milwaukee to see another one of my favorite artists, Gregory Alan Isakov. He is a folk artist who grew up in South Africa, but now lives in Colorado. It was such a fun experience, and I hope I get to see him in concert again at some point.</p>

		<h3>The Driver Era</h3>
		<p>Earlier last year I went to see a band called the Driver Era right here in Madison. I went with some friends and we had such a fun time. This is a pop band that is made up of brothers and it was a sold out show which made for such a fun atmosphere! </p>
