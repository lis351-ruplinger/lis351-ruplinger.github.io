			<p>Dollywood is such a fun experience in Tennessee. I love going on all the rides and checking out the little shops they have there. I also love all the different shows they have there. Last time I went I saw a fireworks and drone light show which was super fun!</p>

			<p>My aunt and uncle live right on the Tennessee River, and you can even see the Smokey Mountians from the water which I love. One of my favorite things to do there is just go out on the boat all day and relax! We swim, tube, and chill out on the water.</p>

			<p>The Smokey Mountians are such a cool place to explore. I've visited them the last couple of times I have been to Tennessee, and it is such an amazing expereince. I even have been able to stay in a cabin in the mountains with my family and it was so pretty.</p>
