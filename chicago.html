		<h1><i>Chicago</i></h1>
		<p>Last summer my family took a day trip to Chicago, Illinois. We took the train down and it was super fun to see the different sites! I'm going to show a few of my favorite things that we saw that day!</p>

			<h3><u>The Bean</u></h3>
			<p>One thing that we saw that day, which is one of the most popular attractions in Chicago, is The Bean! This is a picture of my sister and I in the reflection of The Bean.</p>

			<h3><u>Navy Pier</u></h3>
			<p>Navy Pier is a cool place in Chicago. You can shop, eat, or see the City from the top of a giant Ferris Wheel. One of my favorite things about it was being able to see the City right next to Lake Michigan.</p>

			<p>Willis Tower is a bigger attaction in Chicago as well. Here, we went up to the Skydeck on the 103rd floor and stepped out onto a glass box where you could see an incredible view of the city.</p>
